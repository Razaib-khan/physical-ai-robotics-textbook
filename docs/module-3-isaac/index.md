## Overview

Welcome to Module 3! In this module, we will explore NVIDIA Isaac Sim, a powerful and versatile simulation platform built on NVIDIA's Omniverse. Isaac Sim is designed to enable the development, testing, and training of AI-based robots in a high-fidelity, photorealistic, and physically-accurate virtual environment.

You will learn how to leverage Isaac Sim's advanced features, including its tight integration with ROS 2, its powerful physics engine, and its capabilities for generating synthetic data. We'll also take our first steps into the world of AI-driven robotics by exploring Isaac Gym, NVIDIA's toolkit for reinforcement learning in robotics.

By the end of this module, you'll be able to create stunning and complex simulations and have a foundational understanding of how to train intelligent robot behaviors using cutting-edge AI techniques.
