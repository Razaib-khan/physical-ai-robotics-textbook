## Overview

Welcome to Module 4, where we delve into one of the most exciting and rapidly evolving areas of robotics: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models. VLA models aim to bridge the gap between human-like perception, language understanding, and physical action in robots. Imagine telling a robot, "Pick up the red mug from the table," and it not only understands but also perceives the mug, plans its movements, and executes the task. This is the promise of VLA.

In this module, you will learn how to integrate advanced computer vision techniques with large language models (LLMs) to create robots that can interpret complex commands, understand their surroundings, and perform sophisticated tasks. We will explore the building blocks of VLA systems, from processing visual inputs and comprehending natural language instructions to translating these into actionable robot commands.

By the end of this module, you will have a comprehensive understanding of VLA architectures, practical experience with integrating different AI components, and a glimpse into the future of intelligent, human-robot collaboration.
