# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

Welcome to the **Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics** interactive textbook! This comprehensive resource will guide you through the fundamentals of building intelligent robotic systems, from basic ROS 2 concepts to advanced vision-language-action integration.

## Course Overview

This textbook provides hands-on learning for robotics and AI integration through five major modules and a capstone project. Each module includes detailed explanations, runnable code examples, exercises, and practical deployment guidance.

## Learning Objectives

By completing this textbook, you will:

- **Master ROS 2 fundamentals**: Understand nodes, topics, services, and robot description formats
- **Develop simulation skills**: Create digital twins using Gazebo and Unity
- **Apply AI techniques**: Train robots using NVIDIA Isaac Sim and reinforcement learning
- **Integrate multimodal systems**: Combine vision, language, and action for intelligent behavior
- **Build complete systems**: Design and implement an autonomous humanoid robot

## Prerequisites

Before starting this course, you should have:

- **Programming**: Basic knowledge of at least one programming language (Python or C++ recommended)
- **Linux**: Familiarity with command-line operations (cd, ls, mkdir, etc.)
- **Mathematics**: Understanding of basic linear algebra and calculus concepts
- **Computer**: System capable of running ROS 2 and simulation environments (see [Software Setup](./resources/software-setup.md))

:::tip No Prior Robotics Experience Required
This textbook is designed for learners new to robotics. We'll introduce all concepts from the ground up with clear explanations and practical examples.
