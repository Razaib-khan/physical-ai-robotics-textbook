## Overview

Welcome to Module 2! In this module, you will dive into the world of robotics simulation, a critical tool for modern robotics development. Simulations provide a safe, fast, and cost-effective way to develop and test robot software before deploying it on physical hardware. We will explore two of the most popular simulation platforms in robotics: Gazebo and Unity.

You will learn how to create "digital twins" of your robots and their environments, allowing you to iterate on your designs and algorithms with high fidelity. We'll cover everything from building a simple world to adding complex sensors and integrating it all with ROS 2.

By the end of this module, you will have the skills to build and use simulations for a wide range of robotics applications, a crucial step towards developing more complex and intelligent robots.
