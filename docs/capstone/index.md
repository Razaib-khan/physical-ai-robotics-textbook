## Your Journey Culminates: The Autonomous Humanoid Capstone

Congratulations on reaching the Capstone Project! This is where you bring together all the knowledge and skills acquired throughout Modules 1, 2, 3, and 4. The goal of this capstone is to design, implement, and demonstrate an autonomous humanoid robot system capable of performing complex tasks in a simulated environment.

This project will challenge you to think holistically about robotic systems, integrating perception (vision, sensors), cognition (language understanding, planning, decision-making), and action (manipulation, navigation) into a coherent, intelligent agent. You will apply principles of ROS 2 for system integration, leverage simulation for development and testing, utilize AI concepts from Isaac Sim, and build upon VLA models for human-robot interaction.

The Capstone Project is designed to be a significant undertaking, requiring careful planning, iterative development, and thorough testing. It will serve as a powerful demonstration of your expertise in physical AI and humanoid robotics.

### Project Overview

Your primary task will be to develop a simulated humanoid robot that can understand high-level natural language commands and execute them within a dynamic environment. The project will be broken down into several milestones, each focusing on integrating different aspects of the knowledge you've gained.

Key areas you will cover:
-   **System Architecture Design:** Planning how all the components (ROS 2 nodes, AI models, simulation interfaces) will fit together.
-   **Perception System:** Implementing robust object detection, pose estimation, and scene understanding.
-   **Cognitive System:** Developing mechanisms for natural language understanding, task planning, and decision-making.
-   **Action Execution:** Controlling the humanoid's navigation and manipulation capabilities in simulation.
-   **Integration & Testing:** Bringing all the pieces together and thoroughly evaluating the system's performance.

Successful completion of this capstone will solidify your understanding of advanced robotics and prepare you for real-world challenges in the field.
